# TODO


--- add

- ask if source file changed... changes are lost

- can uri change? other file opened or saved?


- test comments before & after & between (should be removed)


- what if row has more cols? not displayed but are they exported?

- new line is not respected? edit converts auto?
  - disable option & add to help modal

- add option for comments (vs)
  - only show if any (+ expand)
  - for before & after
