# TODO


--- add

- ask if source file changed... changes are lost

- can uri change? other file opened or saved?


- test comments before & after & between (should be removed)


- what if row has more cols? not displayed but are they exported?


## Maybe

store collapse states

- goto source, resourceScheme == csv-edit ... not displayed

- clear command --> delete all instances ?

- clearify why commit (can do undo on file) (in help dialog?)
