# TODO

--- add


- quote char


- ask if source file changed... changes are lost?
  --> should not happen... no update, add to hints (first)



- document workflow...


## Known issues

- when we save an unnamed file (via commit and save) then the unname, editor and saved file are closed...

## Maybe

store collapse states?

- goto source, resourceScheme == csv-edit ... not displayed

- clear command --> delete all instances ?
