# TODO




--- add

- ask if source file changed... changes are lost

- can uri change? other file opened or saved?


- test comments before & after & between (should be removed)


- what if row has more cols? not displayed but are they exported?

## Maybe

store collapse states

- starting with goto command not working

- goto source, resourceScheme == csv-edit ... not displayed

- clear command --> delete all instances ?

- clearify why commit (can do undo on file)

- new line is not respected? edit converts auto?

- add option when last line + enter add new line
- same for col & tab
